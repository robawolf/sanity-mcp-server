# 🚂 Railway Deployment Guide

This guide helps you deploy the Sanity MCP Server to Railway with SSE transport.

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### 1. Environment Variables

Set these environment variables in your Railway project:

**Required:**
```bash
MCP_USER_ROLE=developer
SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your-sanity-project-id
SANITY_DATASET=production
SANITY_API_TOKEN=your-sanity-api-token
```

**Optional:**
```bash
SANITY_API_HOST=https://api.sanity.io
```

### 2. Railway Dashboard Setup

1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. Click on your service
3. Navigate to **"Variables"** tab
4. Add each environment variable:

| Variable | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `MCP_USER_ROLE` | `developer` | User role (developer/editor) |
| `SANITY_PROJECT_ID` | `your-project-id` | Your Sanity project ID |
| `SANITY_DATASET` | `production` | Dataset name |
| `SANITY_API_TOKEN` | `your-token` | Sanity API token |

### 3. Railway CLI Setup (Alternative)

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login
railway login

# Set variables
railway variables set MCP_USER_ROLE=developer
railway variables set SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
railway variables set SANITY_DATASET=production
railway variables set SANITY_API_TOKEN=your-token

# Deploy
railway up
```

## 🔧 Automatic Configuration

The server automatically detects Railway environment and:
- ✅ Uses **SSE transport** by default
- ✅ Binds to `0.0.0.0` (all interfaces)
- ✅ Uses Railway's `PORT` environment variable
- ✅ Skips origin validation for cloud deployment

## 🌐 Access Your Deployed Server

Once deployed, Railway will provide a public URL like:
```
https://your-service-name.railway.app
```

**Available endpoints:**
- `GET /health` - Health check
- `GET /sse` - SSE connection endpoint
- `POST /messages` - Message handling

## 📋 Client Configuration

Use your Railway URL in client configurations:

**Claude Desktop:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sanity": {
      "transport": {
        "type": "sse",
        "url": "https://your-service-name.railway.app/sse"
      },
      "env": {
        "SANITY_PROJECT_ID": "your-project-id",
        "SANITY_DATASET": "production",
        "SANITY_API_TOKEN": "your-token",
        "MCP_USER_ROLE": "developer"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Environment Variable Errors

**Error:**
```
Invalid environment variables {
  MCP_USER_ROLE: {
    _errors: ["Invalid discriminator value. Expected 'developer' | 'editor' | 'internal_agent_role'"]
  }
}
```

**Solution:** Set `MCP_USER_ROLE` to exactly `developer` or `editor`

### Missing Project ID/Dataset

**Error:**
```
SANITY_PROJECT_ID: { _errors: ["Required"] }
SANITY_DATASET: { _errors: ["Required"] }
```

**Solution:** Set both `SANITY_PROJECT_ID` and `SANITY_DATASET` variables

### Authentication Issues

**Error:** API authentication failures

**Solution:** 
1. Verify your `SANITY_API_TOKEN` is correct
2. Ensure the token has appropriate permissions
3. Check that the project ID matches your token's project

### Port Binding Issues

Railway automatically sets the `PORT` environment variable. The server will:
- Use Railway's `PORT` if available
- Default to port 3000 for local development
- Bind to `0.0.0.0` in Railway (required for public access)

### Health Check

Test your deployment:
```bash
curl https://your-service-name.railway.app/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "server": "@sanity/mcp",
  "version": "0.9.3",
  "transport": "sse",
  "activeConnections": 0
}
```

### SSE Connection Issues

**Error:** `Failed to connect via SSE: Error POSTing to endpoint (HTTP 400): InternalServerError: stream is not readable`

**Solution:** This was a concurrency issue with multiple SSE connections. The latest version (0.9.3+) fixes this by implementing session-based connection management.

**Verify the fix:**
1. Check health endpoint shows `activeConnections` count
2. Each SSE connection gets a unique session ID in logs
3. Multiple concurrent connections are supported

**Error:** `Missing sessionId parameter` or `No SSE connection found for session ID`

**Cause:** Client is not using the session ID provided by the SSE endpoint

**Solution:** 
1. Ensure your MCP client follows the SSE protocol correctly
2. The SSE endpoint provides the message endpoint URL with session ID
3. Client must use that exact URL for POST requests

### Testing SSE Connection

Test the SSE endpoint manually:
```bash
# Start SSE connection
curl -N https://your-service-name.railway.app/sse

# You should see:
# event: endpoint
# data: /messages?sessionId=<unique-id>
```

Then use the provided endpoint URL for sending messages.

## 🔒 Security Notes

- **Local Development**: Origin validation enabled, localhost binding
- **Railway Deployment**: Origin validation disabled, public binding
- **CORS**: Enabled for web client compatibility
- **Message Limits**: 4MB maximum message size

## 📝 Logs

Monitor your Railway deployment logs for:
- Server startup messages
- SSE connection establishments
- Error messages
- Environment variable validation

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Test the health endpoint
2. Configure your MCP client
3. Establish SSE connection
4. Start using Sanity tools remotely!
